1) What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?

--I used MongoDB,an NoSQL database, for this project. The biggest benefit is "No schema migrations"
[Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data] of MongoDB.It is much faster
to get a list of collections than to extract a list of the types in a collection.

2) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

--Prior experience and ease to setup connection with mongodb was the easiest part of the project.

3) What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

--Since I never worked on NodeJs before, it was not east to get the project started.

4) If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
   concern?

--Real time data is not always clean and might have noisy data with outliers. Thus for processing that
  kind of data, much more overhead need to be taken into consideration
--Data security is also a concern when we work professionally
